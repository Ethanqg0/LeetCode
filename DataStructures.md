Hash Tables (Maps/Hash Maps):
    Fast lookups (O(1) average-case) and flexible key-value storage.
    Fantastic for maintaining some sort of state because its fast lookup times mean you can find a key fast and immediately be provided the value

Stacks:
    LIFO behavior; efficient push and pop operations.
    Excellent for depth-first algorithms because of their ability to backtrack
    Utilize pop or push to backtrack, dependning on whether you are maintaining the correct solution or incorrect solutions

Linked Lists:
    Dynamic size and efficient insertion/deletion.


Queues:
    FIFO behavior; efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.


Trees:
    Efficient search and traversal (BSTs); hierarchical organization.

Graphs:
    Modeling complex relationships; diverse algorithms.
