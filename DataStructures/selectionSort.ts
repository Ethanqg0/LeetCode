/*
    Selection Sort is arguably the easiest sorting algorithm to understand and implement.
    It's based on the notion of finding the minimum or maximum element in an unsorted array.
    It requires two nested loops, one that iterates from the beginning to the end, and another that finds the minimum or maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array.

    90 20 50 70

    From here, we do a for loop that iterates from the beginning to the end of the array. 20 is the smallest array so we swap the 90 and 20
