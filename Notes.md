LeetCode Top 150

Data Structures
- Sets and Maps utilize hashing, enabling an average case of O(1) time complexity. Collisions, however, can bring worst case of O(n)

Array/String
- Reversing and Shifting
- Always want to accomplish O(n) notation by doing one iteration through the array. This could mean recursion, this could mean implementing clever ways to maintain a goal, this could mean greedy algorithms
